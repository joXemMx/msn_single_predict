# This script finds config.yaml files for models, written during training,
# and modifies them for direct use in the evaluation script.
# It removes:
# * fingerprint cache, database, and baseline paths
# * potentially set eval_counter/id
# * evaluation_set and eval_detail setting
# It adds
# * selection of an evaluation set and eval_detail=True
# * selection of a decoder
# It replaces the path to the original CSV eval database with the
#   replacement pickle, which includes the holdout set definition
